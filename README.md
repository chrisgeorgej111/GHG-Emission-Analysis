GHG Emission Analysis using PowerBi

**Problem Statement:**
Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

This dataset has the records of 9 years..on an average It has about 45 columns.. 
Some of the columns has the units of the some of the features..
This has been cleaned and brought down to 9 columns and created some necessary features.

Finally Using PowerBi visualisation analised the count of organisation, types of sectors, Average useage of Electricity, Natural gas, and GHG Emission as a consequence..

This visualisation also shows the cities and sectors that have used most aount of Natural gas and Electricty also the top cities and sectors that have emitted most amount of Green House Gases..
